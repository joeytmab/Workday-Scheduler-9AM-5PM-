Enclosed is a calendar application, known as a daily work scheduler that functions from 9am-5pm.

User will be able to log on and view the current day, time, and designated timeblocks for standard business hours (0900-1700). Timeblocks are divided hour by hour and are assigned color designations depicting past (grey), future (green) and current (red) hours.

In addition, within each time block contains a text area, allowing user to log multiple tasks accordingly. Via Local Storage within the web client used by the user, the tasks are saved and will persist upon refreshing the page.

This repository contains an Assets folder (containing images and both CSS and JS files) in addition to this README and the updated index.html file.
